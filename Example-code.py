"""
AI Debugging Assistant — Example Demonstration
------------------------------------------------
This script demonstrates how the I-Debugging Prompt concept works in practice.

Instead of directly fixing the student’s code, the AI Debugging Assistant provides
hints, explanations, and guiding questions to help the student identify and correct
their own mistakes.

Note: This is not an actual AI model — it is a conceptual simulation
to showcase the learning-based approach.

# Example of a student's buggy Python code
# ---------------------------

def add_numbers(a, b):
    # The function is meant to print the sum of two numbers.
    # However, there's a syntax error in the print statement below.
    result = a + b
    print("Sum is" result)  # ❌ Missing comma between string and variable


# ---------------------------
# Simulated AI Debugging Assistant response
# ---------------------------

# In a real conversation, the assistant would analyze the error and guide the student.
# It does not directly fix the issue but gives conceptual hints and reflective questions.

print("💡 I think there might be a small syntax issue in your print statement.")
print("When you combine text and variables in print(), how do you usually separate them?")
print("Try to recall the symbol we use to separate multiple items inside print().")
print("Once you fix that, what do you expect the output to look like? 🧐")
