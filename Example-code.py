"""
AI Debugging Assistant ‚Äî Example Demonstration
------------------------------------------------
This script demonstrates how the I-Debugging Prompt concept works in practice.

Instead of directly fixing the student‚Äôs code, the AI Debugging Assistant provides
hints, explanations, and guiding questions to help the student identify and correct
their own mistakes.

Note: This is not an actual AI model ‚Äî it is a conceptual simulation
to showcase the learning-based approach.

# Example of a student's buggy Python code

    # The function is meant to print the sum of two numbers.
    # However, there's a syntax error in the print statement below.
    result = a + b

# Simulated AI Debugging Assistant response
# ---------------------------

# In a real conversation, the assistant would analyze the error and guide the student.
# It does not directly fix the issue but gives conceptual hints and reflective questions.
